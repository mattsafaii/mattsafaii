I hate social media. Earlier this year I deleted all my accounts for good. I got tired of the endless scrolling and needed to focus on creating. I don’t want to put my energy into platforms I don’t own, to see my posts get buried under the latest retarded trend.

Fuck the algorithm.

That’s where this website comes in. This is my space. It’s where I can share what I’m working on, what I’m thinking about, and even meet other like-minded people. Let’s be honest, it’s hard to find those in the wild. Writing here lets me explore ideas I find cool, even if they only ever reach a handful of people who feel the same.

There’s another layer to this. Writing is good for me. It forces me to slow down, organize my thoughts, and put something out into the world that feels true. That’s something social media can’t give me — and something I want more of in my life.

This site is more than a place to share my thoughts. It’s a way to promote my projects without feeling sales-y or fake. If you’re here, you might already care about the same things I do, and I’m excited to share what I’m working on with you.

With all that said – Welcome to my corner of the internet. No ads, no slop, only ideas worth sharing. Thanks for stopping by. Let’s see where this goes.
